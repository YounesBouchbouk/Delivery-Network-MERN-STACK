delivery network web application that allows users to send and track their packages efficiently. In addition to individual users, the platform facilitates collaboration among different delivery services to ensure seamless package delivery to customers.

- Key features include:
  
    - **Package Sending and Tracking:** Users can easily send packages and track their status in real-time through the application.
    - **Service Collaboration:** Delivery services can work together to fulfill delivery requests, optimizing routes and resources.
    - **Intelligent Routing:** We utilize a Neo4j graph database to map out city connections. If a direct delivery service between two cities is unavailable, the system intelligently splits the delivery route using intermediate cities, ensuring timely and efficient package delivery.
